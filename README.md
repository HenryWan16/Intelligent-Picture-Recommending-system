# Intelligent-Picture-Recommending-system
The intelligent system can help you get the best matching result if you take a photo and send it to the server with your mobile. The system has been divided into several parts including UI designing, message sending, picture character extracting and so on. 
As a member of our team, I also help others to build the CouchDB on the server. 
With the help of CEDD character extracting, we can get the matching result quickly.

## CEDD 
CEDD is short for Color and Edge Directivity Descriptor, which can be used to abstract the features of some pictures.
